#Mr Figs ToDo


###General
- Need a menu to display when you press 'esc'
- Level select area

###Imagery

- Spike sprites (read the spike section)
- Bomb blasts
- Need bomb sprite images
- Need player sprite images
- Create a backdrop for the game so that it's not just a horrible white background on smaller levels
- Maybe have sprites that are taller than 50px but only their bottom 50px is collidable/solid? Might make visuals more interesting.

###Music & SFX

As there are 5 areas to Mr Figs (Grass, Desert/Beach, Cave, Snow, Castle),
There will need to be a **minimum** of 5 tracks (1 per area).

Ideally the music will be the same track but maybe with different themes going on? Look up 'Stiglitz' as an example. The verses are happy but the chorus is evil. Perhaps we could have have for the Desert and then evil for Cave. Or something along those lines...


#####Music

Names are after the : but may be subject to change.

- Grass Track   : Mr Figs' Lawn
- Desert Track  : Mr Figs' Sandbox
- Snow Track    : Mr Figs' Snowman
- Cave Track    : Mr Figs' Safeplace
- Castle Track  : Mr Figs' Castle

#####SFX

There will need to be sound effects for the following sounds

- Bomb placement 
	-  Ideally 2-3 variations of the placement

- Bomb explosion
	- Again, 2-3 different variations of the explosion

- Spikes

- Ambience
	- Ambience for each level
		- Wind for the desert level
		- Birds/tweets for grass etc...

- Button presses


###Code

- Package it into an exe
- Make the modules properly importable rather than having to copy and paste them into things
- Bomberman's starting position should be on the text file


##Ideas

- Have a target amount of moves for each level. (i.e. let the user know it's possible to finish this level in 7 moves).
